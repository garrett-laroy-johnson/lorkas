README - inChuckV3

Performing inChuck is done entirely from the command-line in a program called Terminal.  If you have never run a computer from the command-line, fear not. It's fairly simple.

Open the Terminal application, and you will be "located" in your home directory, represented by the tilde (~) symbol.  To change directories, type "cd directory", where cd means change directory, and directory is the new folder/directory to which you want to go.

To start inChuck, type:

	cd ~/Desktop/inChuckV3
	
and then hit the return key.  You should now be in the inChuckV3 folder.  From here there is a script specifically to launch inChuckV3 and all it's related code.  To launch the script, type:

	sh scripts/launch_inchuck.sh
	
This will open up two new windows in Terminal.  One window has instructions for how to play (and restart if needed) inChuck. The other is the window into which you type commands.  Read the instructions, and then play.

Have fun.
