To play the "Rainforest Machine":

Open "rainforest" in Supercollider. Start the server, 
click the code, and press Ctrl + Enter.

4 players are needed to play each of the 4 parts (birds, 
frogs, animals, ambiant), although more players can play.
Parts are selected from the green drop-down menu. 

Some of the sounds are more intrusive, so the parts 
should be evenly distributed among the players. For 
example, if 7 people are playing, there should be at 
least one on each part, and more people playing
"forest", than playing "birds" etc.

To begin the piece, have some of the players start the 
background rain noise by clicking the blue button, "Make
it Rain!", it helps if everyone gradually enters the
piece, instead of all at once. To begin the additional 
animal noises, begin clicking on the pop-up windows that
generate throughout the piece. Clicking one one will 
immediately cause it to darken and a new one will appear.
Begin by slowly clicking the pop-ups, and gradually 
clicking them faster and faster. 

To end the piece, gradually decrease the speed you are 
moving your mouse and clicking the generated pop-up 
windows, until only rain noise is left. To stop the 
piece entirely, click on the red "Close All" button, and
all the windows will close, the rain will stop, and 
any remaining sounds will shortly end.
